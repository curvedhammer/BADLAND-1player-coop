# Make COOP in BADLAND easier and better while playing solo.
Initially, this program was created for myself, but I decided that it could be published here.
This program is designed to solve the problem that occurs in the game BADLAND, when a player playing alone in the cooperative mode (COOP) must simultaneously press the control keys of both (or more) players. This is certainly quite difficult and tedious. Therefore, this program is designed to make it easier to play COOP, especially when you are playing alone.
When the program window is active, the player can control other players by pressing the control key for one player. The program also works with 3 or 4 players, in addition to two.

# Installation
## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- pip
- pynput

## Select the version
You only need to select the appropriate version of the program. "ARROWS" or "WAD" are the names of the keys that a player usually uses to control a character in a singleâ€”player game.
- ARROWS: if the player prefers up key, left key, right key.
- WAD: if the player prefers W key, A key, D key.
- TFH: if the player prefers T key, F key, H key.
- IJL: if the player prefers J key, K key, L key.

## Starting the program
After installation, run the program (either from the downloads folder or by using the command line) and simply start playing. If you want to quit the game, simply close the program window.

## Recommendations
It's better to install the raw file by clicking on the "BLkeyboard_(keys)" and then clicking on the raw file download button.
I recommend using the ARROWS version so that you don't have to close the program every time you type text between game.
