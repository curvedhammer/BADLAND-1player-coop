# Make COOP in BADLAND better while playing solo.
A small program created initially for personal use to gain achievements related to COOP mode in BADLAND.
This solves the problem that the player has to press buttons at the same time to advance as two players to complete missions such as “Nobody dies.”
Works with 2, 3 or 4 players at the same time.

# Installation
## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- pip
- pynput

## Select the version
Select the appropriate version of the program. ARROWS or WAD means keys that will be controlled by 2 or more players.
- ARROWS: if the player prefers up key, left key, right key.
- WAD: if the player prefers W key, A key, D key.
- TFH: if the player prefers T key, F key, H key.
- IJL: if the player prefers J key, K key, L key.

## Starting the program
After installation, run the file (in the downloads folder or via the command line), and just play. If you decide to finish the game, just close the program window.

## Recommendations
Install the raw file by clicking on the BLkeyboard_(keys) and clicking on the raw file download button.
I recommend using the ARROWS version so that you don't have to close the program every time you type text between game.
